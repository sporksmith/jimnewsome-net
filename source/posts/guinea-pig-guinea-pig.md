Guinea Pig Guinea Pig is an HTML5 game made for the
[2013 Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/guinea-pig-guinea-pig).
You play a (further) miniaturized, super-powered, Guinea Pig.
Your job is to weaken (with your eye-lasers, of course) and collect
the germs infecting the patient's arteries, while contending with
the rhythmic blood flow.

Made with Brian Bogovich and [Lara Schenk](http://notlaura.com/).
Soundtrack "Bang That Accordian" by [Bonnie Bogovich](http://www.blackcatbonifide.com/).
