## Creative Coding

### EepEepMotion

EepEepMotion is a tool for *opportunistic stop motion*; given a set of
photographs with some common object (e.g., a stuffed monkey) in them,
and create an animation using individual photos as animation
frames. To achieve this, the user to label where the target object is
in each photo using the custom Processing program, creates an
animation with a place-holder object using the standard Blender tools,
exports the animation using a custom Blender plugin, and renders the
animation with the Processing tool.

This tool was developed to create the
[Travels of Code Monkey](#travels-of-code-monkey) video. With a little
work it could be generalized and made more user-friendly.

### Piranha Tank

Piranha Tank is a tablet/smart-phone toy in which a swarm of hungry
piranhas pursues and munches on the user's finger. I built it with
Haxe and NME, allowing it to be deployed across many platforms.

Current builds (work in progress):

 * [Flash](piranha-tank/piranha-tank.swf): Play in your browser
 * [Android](piranha-tank/piranha-tank-debug.apk): Install on your
   Android device ("Unknown sources" must be enabled)

 * [NME](http://www.haxenme.org/)
 * [HaxePunk](http://haxepunk.com/)

### Creator

Creator was created for the 2012
[Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/), tying for second
place. I was involved in the game design and implementation. This
included creating a custom audio manager to handle synchronized and
positioned musical loops.

> Part music mix box, part Nibbler, and part 'just a fun tech
> toy'. Devour your own tail to create new planets. Planets grow and
> evolve and can be consumed again. Each planet grows musically, and
> all planets combined make a lush soundtrack. Make your own universe,
> losing part of yourself every time and devour planets to get your
> tail back to start the cycle anew.

### Doc Brown mind-reading helmet

Helped create a replica of
[Doc Brown's mind-reading helmet](images/doc-brown-thinking-cap-back-to-the-future.jpg),
originally for a group Halloween costume. I designed and integrated
the pulsing LED system, (with pulse rate controllable by a
potentiometer), using an Arduino.

* Used as "time projection helmet" in the short film: [Sleeptalkers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FhZdwLL6iI&t=1m).
