## Creative Coding

### EepEepMotion and Travels of Code Monkey

EepEepMotion is a tool for *opportunistic stop motion*; given a set of
photographs with some common object (e.g., a stuffed monkey) in them,
and create an animation using individual photos as animation
frames. To achieve this, the user to label where the target object is
in each photo using the custom Processing program, creates an
animation with a place-holder object using the standard Blender tools,
exports the animation using a custom Blender plugin, and renders the
animation with the Processing tool.

This tool was developed to create the Travels of Code Monkey
video. With a little work it could be generalized and made more
user-friendly.

### Piranha Tank

Piranha Tank is a tablet/smart-phone toy in which a swarm of hungry
piranhas pursues and munches on the user's finger. I built it with
Haxe and NME, allowing it to be deployed across many platforms.

### Creator

Creator was created for the 2012
[Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/). I was involved in the
game design and implementation, which included creating a custom audio
manager to handle synchronized and positioned musical loops.

> Part music mix box, part Nibbler, and part 'just a fun tech
toy'. Devour your own tail to create new planets. Planets grow and
evolve and can be consumed again. Each planet grows musically, and all
planets combined make a lush soundtrack. Make your own universe,
losing part of yourself every time and devour planets to get your tail
back to start the cycle anew.

EepEepMotion
-------------

EepEepMotion is a tool for what I call *opportunistic stop motion*. It
allows the user to label where some object is, and how it is oriented,
in a set of photographs, and then render an animation using those
photographs. This tool was developed to help create the Travels of
Code Monkey video. With a little work it could be generalized and made
a bit more intuitive to use.
